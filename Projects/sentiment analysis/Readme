Here's an overview of the main techniques and components used in this project:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Text cleaning using regular expressions
   - Handling of URLs, usernames, and emojis
   - Contraction expansion
   - Lowercasing and special character removal

2. Text Representation:
   - Word2Vec: Used for creating word embeddings
   - Tokenization: Converting text to sequences of integers

3. Data Visualization:
   - Bar plots for sentiment distribution
   - Word clouds for positive and negative sentiments

4. Deep Learning Model:
   - Architecture: Bidirectional LSTM layers followed by Conv1D and Dense layers
   - Embedding layer initialized with pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings
   - Binary classification (positive/negative sentiment)

5. Model Training and Evaluation:
   - Use of callbacks: ReduceLROnPlateau and EarlyStopping
   - Visualization of training history (accuracy and loss)
   - Confusion matrix and classification report for model evaluation

6. Additional Techniques:
   - Data splitting using train_test_split
   - Sequence padding for uniform input length
   - Model and data saving for future use

This notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of these techniques, along with explanations and visualizations to aid understanding. By the end, you'll have a trained model capable of predicting sentiment in tweet-like text data.
